# What Day of March 2020 is it?

In moments of dark humor, I've been giving the date as the number of days since the beginning of March 2020. Figuring out the number of days since a date nearly two years ago gets to be annoying, so I've written a short PHP program to do the calculation for me.

The World Health Organization declared COIVD-19 to be a pandemic on March 11, 2020.  COVID-19 was first declared a public health emergency on January 30, 2020, so if you like to report the day relative to January 1, just change the `PANDEMIC_START_DATE` constant in the `PandemicData` class.

And please, get vaccianted. I know too many people who've lost loved ones (spouses, neighbors, close friends); I don't want to see anyone else lose someone they love.
